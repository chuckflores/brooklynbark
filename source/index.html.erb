      <h2>Individual Care</h2>
      <p>
        Dogs and other animals get to know and trust individual people. This is why you will have a primary care giver and a backup for those emergencies.

        As the bond between walker and pup becomes strong, that is when truly personalized walks are formed. Walks are not only for a potty break but also a break from sleeping on the couch and having a bit of excitement.
